# civicrm_entity_pcp

This module provides some basic integration of CiviCRM Personal Campaign Pages as a Drupal entity type. 

It also adds some PCP functionality for the event registration form....

If you enable PCP for your event, you can append a url parameter to the url, e.g /civicrm-event/1?pcpId=1
